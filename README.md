# Name of the Project

The Film Fetcher

## Description

The Film Fetcher is an interactive web application that displays a list of movies using The Movie DB API, and allows the user to click on any movie to display reviews for it on a separate web page, using Metacritic's API. A history of movies the user has clicked on is stored in local storage and displayed either on the side of the screen, or at the bottom of the page, depending on the user's device and resolution. The website is flexible with mobile devices. Styling was done using Bulma CDN.

## Credit Where Credit Is Due

Rasmi R. wrote the majority of the javascript, did troubleshooting and resolved various issues with the code, and was a helpful and reliable partner overall for this group project. You're awesome, thank you!

Joseph M. designed the majority of the page layout, spent lots of time hitting his head against Bulma's CDN, wrote the javascript for local storage/history, and acted as project manager. 

Instructor Phil Loy helped both of us out tremendously with this, both during the project itself, and by way of thoroughly explaining javascript functions and API usage during class (which I had to watch the recordings of multiple times before I could wrap my head around this)
